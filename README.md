# React-Material-Boilerplate

A boilerplate with all the latest features for a slick production-ready [Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications). I'm also giving the context hook API a go for state management instead of redux.

## Features

[x] Webpack with typescript config files without Babel
[x] Hot Module Replacement
[x] CSS, LESS and SCSS Global and Modular support
[x] TSLint-Prettier-Husky auto-formatting synced with VSCode settings
[x] Bash scripts for quick/easy development/building/deployment
[x] Code splitting with React.lazy, Suspense and chunks labelled by content hash and `webpackChunkName`
